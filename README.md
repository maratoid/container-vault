This project was copied from an older, lesser-used repo [samsung-cnct/vault](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/vault). This project was started using the [solas-container](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas-container) repo.

The purpose of this repo is to maintain the Docker container assets for the Hashicorp Vault application for [Kraken](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/kraken) Cluster-ops et al for Samsung-CNCT projects.

This project will automaticaly get checked by Jenkins and then, upon successful testing, built and submitted to Quay.
