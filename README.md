This project was copied from an older lesser-used repo [samsung-cnct/vault]. This project was started using the [solas-container] repo.

The purpose of this repo is to maintain the Docker container assets for the Hashicorp Vault application for Kraken Cluster-ops et al for Samsung-CNCT projects.

This project will automaticaly get checked by Jenkins and then, upon successful testing, built and submitted to Quay.
